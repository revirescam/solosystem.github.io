# Enclosures

* TOC
{:toc}

This document covers Enclosures and waterproofind for the Solo.  The Solo:basic uses 2 enclosures:

* Main external enclosure [dribox 200](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dribox+200)
* Smaller internal box to protect electronics.

### Main external enclosure.

I am a fan of the dribox 200 as it has the best system for the passage
of cables from inside-outside I have seen.  It is marketed for use for
mains (utility) power in domestic gardens - for things like christmas
trees or water features.

These boxes are are [IP55 certified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code).

The lid acts as an umbrella over the entire unit.  It has spongy seals
at each end of the box, which squeeze around the microphone cable
making a good seal.  There are many "electronic project boxes" for
sale, but none had such a convenient system as this.  I don't have
shares in dribox - it's just a good product.

If you are using an external power source and need to run power cable
to your battery (or nuclear power plant), then the cable for that can
pass through the sponge at the other end (there are two cable
pass-throughs in the 200).

### Small internal box

The internal box is to provide the electronics with physical
protection against damage from being rattled around in the box.  It
also means that users don't touch the electronics often - even when
changing the memory card.

The box I suggest does the job, but isn't really that appropriate. The
2 cables (wire and power) don't pass nicely, the lid is tricky to
remove and replace.  So it's not great, but it is cheap (less than a
pound).
