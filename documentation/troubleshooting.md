# Best practices and troubleshooting

General points / best practices
-------------------------------

* You will find it increasingly important to keep a careful note of
  the field position, date and times of establishing recording,
  particularly if you are using multiple Solos

* Remember that the Solo software should be flashed onto each memory card
  before each time that it is inserted into the Solo.

* Try not to unplug the power cable to the Raspberry Pi unless
  necessary since it is a fragile connection. Instead, unplug the
  power cable at the battery end, which is a larger and stronger
  connection. Ensure that the orientation of the connections is
  correct

* best policy to detach the battery when inserting/removing the
  SD-card.

* write protect slider on sd-cards should be covered in tape to hold
  in place.

* The flashing software and the harvesting software should be
  installed directly on your Windows PC - installations on network
  drives don’t appear to work.  [ I can’t confirm this, and don’t
  understand why].
