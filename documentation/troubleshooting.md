# Best practices and troubleshooting

* You will find it increasingly important to keep a careful note of
  the field position, date and times of establishing recording,
  particularly if you are using multiple Solos.

* Remember that the Solo Operating System Image (SOSI) should be
  flashed onto each memory card before each time that it is inserted
  into the Solo.

* Try not to unplug the power cable to the Raspberry Pi unless
  necessary since it is a fragile connection. Instead, unplug the
  power cable at the battery end, which is a larger and stronger
  connection. Ensure that the orientation of the connections is
  correct.

* Do not insert or remove the memory card while power is attached.
