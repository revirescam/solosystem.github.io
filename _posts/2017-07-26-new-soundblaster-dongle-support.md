title:  "New SoundBlaster dongle support (USB)"

The previously recommended Cirrus Logic Audio Card has been
discontinued (as far as I can tell). This had been the audio card
selected for the Solo:basic hardware configuration, a name I now
regret choosing.

So we've expanded support for USB audio-cards to include the "Sound
Blaster 2 Play" dongle, which allows you to choose your own
microphone.

Note that this differs from the "blue:snowflake" and ultrasonic
"dodotronic" microphones in that the microhpone is separated from the
audio-card, so you _can_ choose your own microphone.

TODO:
	Take the emphasis OFF CLAC discontinuation, and onto SB2 support and a new SOSI.
	Finish this post (deconfuse the microphone selection paragraphs)
	add links to this page
	Add some photos to this page.
	Change the front page
	Add a paragraph about new Sosi release.
	Change the front page to include photos of the SB2.
	remove the disclaimer on the front page.
	Change Solo:basic to Solo:clac
	Add section to documentation about SB2 config options.

Later: sort out clocks.
