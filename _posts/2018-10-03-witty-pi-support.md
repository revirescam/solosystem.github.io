The Witty Pi hardware board is now supported to save power when you
dont' want to record.

Power consumption has always been the biggest limitation of the Solo,
and this alleviates that by turning off the Raspberry Pi when
recording is not required.

More details of how to get it working are [here](/documentation/calendar.html).
