### Solo field recorder

The Solo is an autonomous, high definition audio recorder for
unattended environmental monitoring. Protected in a weatherproof
enclosure, the Solo comprises a microphone, mini-computer and battery.
It is tailored for long-term, continuous recording, with data being
stored on a removable memory card.

The Solo is straightforward to assemble, and inexpensive at around
£120 (including a 5-day battery, memory card and a really good
microphone). The cost without battery and memory card is £83 (for
comparison with commercial systems).  But there's a lot of flexibility
with components if you are picky (hydrophones work, for example).

A typical deployment (pictured above) would be powered by a USB
battery bank which would run the system for five days of permanent
recording, 24 hours per day.  Alternatively, a 12kg car battery runs
the Solo for about 40 days, 24/7.

Recordings are split into manageable 10-minute long files which are
stored on the memory card, grouped into an intuitive folder-per-day
layout.  The recordings are in the .wav format which is compatible
with almost all audio software. Everything is configurable.

It is simple to prepare (flash) the memory card with the software to
run the Solo, and just as easy to harvest the audio data onto your
desktop/laptop using a card reader.  All software is free to download
and licensed openly.

There is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XVUWGGwwcc) describing the solo.
