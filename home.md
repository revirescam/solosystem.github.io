The Solo is an autonomous, high definition audio recorder for horse-proof
unattended environmental monitoring. Protected in a weatherproof
enclosure, the Solo comprises a microphone, mini-computer and battery.
It is tailored for long-term, continuous recording, with data being
stored on a removable memory card.

The Solo is straightforward to assemble, and inexpensive
compared to comparable commercial systems. A basic Solo costs around
Â£120, including a battery, memory card and a really good
microphone.  But there's a lot of flexibility with components if you
are picky.

A typical deployment would be powered by a USB battery bank which
would run the system for five days of permanent recording, 24 hours
per day.  A 12kg car battery recently powered a Solo for over 40 days.

Recordings are split into manageable 10-minute long files which are
stored on the memory card - grouped into an intuitive folder-per-day
layout.  The recordings are in the .wav format which is compatible
with almost all audio software.

It is simple to prepare (flash) the memory card with the software to
run the Solo, and just as easy to harvest the audio data onto your
desktop/laptop using a card reader.  All software is free to download
and licensed openly.
