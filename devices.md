## Device


Every Solo is built from roughly the same components: a mini computer and
microphone, with data being stored on a memory card. It is protected
by a weatherproof enclosure, and powered by a battery.

However, there is a lot of flexibility with the individual components
of the Solo, so it can be tailored to your particular needs.

### Solo:basic

The Solo:basic is a standardised system that fulfills most needs.

It will record continuously for 5.5 days using the USB powerbank which
fits inside the enclosure, and produce mono, 16kHz, 16 bit audio files,
each 10 minutes long, each labelled with the date and time it was recorded.


The Solo:basic is easy to assemble - head to the
[Getting&nbsp;Started](/documentation/getting-started.html) guide, or
have a look at the [assembly video](https://youtu.be/2Fq05JlEKjw?t=122).
