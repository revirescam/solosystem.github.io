# About

The Solo was developed as a serviceable field recorder for use in a
remote tropical rainforest, where importing commercial equipment and
returning broken hardware for servicing is difficult and costly.

Additionally, it was important that the device was:

* inexpensive - so we don't care if it's dropped, stolen or trampled
* servicable in-situ - we assume no access to customer service / returns
* available - components are available as widely as possible
* no configuration required at point of installation (settings can be changed in the lab/office, and don't need to be set in the field)
* versatile (any microphone, any battery etc...)
* affordable to projects, people and organisations of all sizes in all countries
* modular - broken units can be repaired and maintained
* modifiable, tailorable, extensible - you can make changes to hardware and software to suit your needs


### Feedback, questions, help and contributing

Although the Solo has been in use for a few years, it remains under
active development to keep up with new hardware and software.

If you have ideas or a request for new functionality, email
r.c.whytock@stir.ac.uk .  If you can code - look at the [github
site](https://www.github.com/solo-system).  If you have a success
story, let us know.

Solo was developed by James Christie.  Robbie Whytock
(r.c.whytock@stir.ac.uk) contributed to design and conducted field
testing during development.
