# About

The Solo was developed to solve a need within our research project to
have a serviceable field recorder for use in a remote tropical
rainforest, where importing equipment and returning broken hardware for
servicing is difficult and costly.

Additionally, it was important that the device was:

* inexpensive - so we don't care if it's dropped, stolen or trampled
* servicable in-situ - we assume no access to customer service / returns
* available - components are available as widely as possible
* no configuration required at point of installation (settings can be changed in the lab/office, and don't need to be set in the field)
* versatile (any microphone, any battery etc...)
* affordable to projects, people and organisations of all sizes in all countries
* modular: broken units can be repaired and maintained
* modifiable, tailorable, extensible - you can make changes to hardware and software to suit your needs

Although the Solo has been in use for a few years, it remans under
active development to keep up with new hardware and software.

### Feedback, questions, help and contributing

If you have ideas or a request for new functionality, leave a
comment on our facebook page.    If you can code - look at the [github
site](www.github.com/solo-system).

If you have a success story, let us know, to make us feel good.

Solo was developed by James Christie (info@solo-system.org) and
adopted early for field use by Robin Whytock.

There is a facebook page, where you can commment or ask questions (and
answer them).  Alternatively, email me directly at info@solo-system.org
