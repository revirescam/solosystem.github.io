## Downloads

The Solo needs software to run it, and that software is called: SOSI (Solo Operating System Image).

Download the most recent SOSI from the page below, then [transfer (flash)](/documentation/flashing.html)
it onto the memory card before being inserted in the Solo. See the
[Getting&nbsp;Started](/documentation/getting-started.html) guide.

<form action="http://www.solo-system.org/sosi">
    <input class="download-button" type="submit" value="Go to SOSI download site">
</form>

## Code

All the code behind the Solo project is free and open.
If you would like to contribute, have a look at <a
href="http://www.github.com/solo-system">the github site</a>, where
you will find three repositories:
[`solo`](http://www.github.com/solo-system/solo) sets up the Raspberry
Pi to host the audio recorder software
[`amon`](http://www.github.com/solo-system/solo-system.github.io), and
the documentation for this website is in the third repository
called
[`solo-system.github.io`](http://www.github.com/solo-system/solo-system.github.io)
