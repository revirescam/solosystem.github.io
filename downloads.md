## Downloads

The SOSI (Solo Operating System Image) is needed to run every Solo.
It must be [transferred (flashed)](/documentation/flashing.html)
onto the memory card before being inserted in the Solo. See the
[Getting&nbsp;Started](/documentation/getting-started.html) guide.

## Code

All the code behind the Solo project is licensed and developed openly.
If you would like to contribute, have a look at <a
href="http://www.github.com/solo-system">the github site</a>, where
you will find three repositories:
[`solo`](http://www.github.com/solo-system/solo) sets up the Raspberry
Pi to host the audio recorder software
[`amon`](http://www.github.com/solo-system/solo-system.github.io).
The documentation for this very website is in the third repository
called
[`solo-system.github.io`](http://www.github.com/solo-system/solo-system.github.io)
