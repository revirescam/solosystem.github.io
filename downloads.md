## Downloads

The SOSI (Solo Operating System Image) is needed to run every Solo.
It must be [transferred (flashed)](/documentation/flashing.html)
onto the memory card before being inserted in the Solo. See the
[Getting&nbsp;Started](/documentation/getting-started.html) guide.

## Code

All the code behind the Solo project is licensed and developed openly.  If you would like to contribute, have a look at <a href="http://www.github.com/solo-system">the github site</a>, where you will find three repositories: `solo` sets up the raspberry pi to host the audio recorder `amon`.  Documentation (this very site) is in the other repo: <a href="http://www.github.com/solo-system/solo-system.github.io/"> here.</a>
